        <strong>Mission:</strong> To provide a sanctuary for applied hardware security research and learning, inspired by the original Cult of the Dead Cow's message of making hacking accessible to every schoolkid. We aim to foster a community where members can share insights, collaborate on projects, and collectively push the boundaries of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vision:</strong> To become a globally recognized hub for applied hardware security research and innovation, and to elevate Malaysian talent to a global standard of mastery.
